* Chapter 5: Types
  ~(->)~ is a type constructor taking two arguments.

  Multiple type constraints are expressed as a tuple before the typeclass arrow
  ~(=>)~.

  Polymorphic means "made of many forms" in contrast to /monomorphic/ meaning
  "made of one form".

  2 types of polymorphism:

    - /parametric polymorphism/
    - /constrained polymorphism/

  The type of polymorphism in Java facilitating dynamic dispatch is called
  /ad-hoc polymorphism/ whereas generics are an implementation of /parametric polymorphism/.

  "If a variable represents a set of possible values, then a type variable
  represents a set of possible types".

  A function is polymorphic when it has type variables in its type signature.

  *(?)* What does /parametricity/ mean? Something about the behaviour of a function
  not being able to change because it is applied to an argument of a different type.
