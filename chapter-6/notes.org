* Chapter 6: Typeclasses
** What are typeclasses?
   Define how a set of types are *consumed*, i.e. their interface.

   We can use ~:info Type~ to query the typeclass instances of ~Type~.

   - ~Bounded~ is a type class for types that have upper and lower bounds.
   - ~Enum~ is a type class for types that can be enumerated
   - ~Read~ is a type class for types that can be read from strings, *AVOID*
   - ~Show~ is a type class for types that can be rendered to strings,
     interestingly you're not encouraged to avoid it unlike ~Read~.

   One can *derive* certain typeclasses which means the implementation code is
   automatically generated, these typeclasses are:

   - ~Eq~
   - ~Ord~
   - ~Enum~
   - ~Bounded~
   - ~Read~
   - ~Show~
